        <p><b>Hello! </b>My name is Nicholas but most people just call
          me Nick. I developed this site to try and refine my
          web development skills and share some of the things I love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been teaching myself photography since I was 12 so my library is huge,
          yet I haven't really curated that collection. I have started the work of paring down the thousands
          of photos I have taken and curating the best selection over the years. I hope to start to work of transferring
          those photos to this site in 2025.
        </p>
          
          <p>
          A new hobby I picked up in the last few years involved buying a Cricut machine on a whim. This has transformed into a new love for crafts
            and crafting. I have made various things over the last few years that have, honestly, impressed myself! Many thanks deserved to the
            many creators online who share such great SVGs and project ideas as that inspiration and ease has made becoming a crafter so much
            easier.
        </p>
          <p>
          In university, I had an awakening on the food industry and the horrors I had been contributing to with my diet. I have been 
          eating plant based for over 5 years now. In that journey I have discovered many of the things I was eating before were contributing
            to my poor gut health. Eating a healthy balanced diet with treats always allowed (in moderation of course) is important to me and I 
            would like to share some of the favourite things I like to eat here with you. I also like to encourage others to adopt a more plant
            based diet for various reasons including animal welfare, environmental harm, and general health.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's clear that my true love is to be creative and I hope I can share
          that with you; whether that be through my crafts, recipes, or
          photography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best Regards,
        </p>
