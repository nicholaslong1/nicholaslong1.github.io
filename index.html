        <p><b>Hello! </b>My name is Nicholas but most people just call
          me Nick. I developed this site to try and refine my
          web development skills and share some of the things I love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a third year computer science student with a passion for networking.
          I enjoy learning about the ways these networks are connected to create
          the internet that controls the modern age. In addition, I love the
          applications that have risen out of this like YouTube, Reddit,
          and streaming services which take up most of my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I'm home at you don't find me at my computer, there is a good chance
          I am in the kitchen. I love experimenting with different recipes to
          see what I can create. This year I decided that I would finally
          switch to a vegetarian diet which adds a fun new challenge in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the weather is warm I like to get out and see what I can
          capture with my camera. Hiking is my one my favourite outdoor activites
          and I can usually find some pretty interesting things to take photos of.
          Occasionally I can convince friends and family to let me do portraits
          which is always a fun time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's clear that my true love is to be creative and I hope I can share
          that with you; whether that be through my tech projects, recipes, or
          photography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warm Regards,
        </p>
